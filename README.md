# Semantic HTML5 Single Page Application (SPA)

Welcome to Semantic HTML5 Single Page Application (SPA).  The purpose of this project is to investigate semantic HTML5 in a single page.
It uses the nav, header, section, article, figure, figcaption, aside and footer tags.

## UX

The sections are divided into home, computing, music and holidays.  The organising principle is interests.

In the home section, users can go to the footer section to find out who the author is.

As a user, I want to see who created this project.

It has a brief description of each section.

In the computing section, there are 3 articles - skills, screenshots and links to professional associations.

As a user, I want skills to be divided into Front End, Back End and Other Skills.

As a user, I want the screenshot to be no larger than its original width.

I want the links to professional organisations to be coloured green.  It changes to orange on hover.
When I click on a link, the link opens in a new window without leaving the web page.

In the music section, a table is provided.

As a user, I want the headings to be coloured light blue.  I want the table to be responsive.

In the holidays section, 6 images are provided.

As a user, I want a blue border on each image.  When hovering over the image, I want
the border to be orange.

I also want a brief description of the image (e.g. Benidorm).

As a user, I want to see a screentip (e.g. Cambridge Python User Group) when I hover over a link.
